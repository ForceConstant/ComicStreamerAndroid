# ComicStreamerAndroid
A library to allow Android/Java applications to access comic-streamer server


See test directory for examples.

Utilizes ComicStreamer server at https://github.com/beville/ComicStreamer to be able to stream server based comics to a client. Can provide whole archives and individual pages.

I also have made a C# version: https://github.com/ForceConstant/ComicStreamerSharp
